# Explanation

*  I solved the problem by using a stack. However, to keep track of the max value in the main stack in an efficient manner, I used another stack, which guarantees that the complexity for the max method will be O(1)

# How to Use
* `git clone git@github.com:ahmadabdelhalim/max.git`
* `cd max`
* run `ruby main.rb` in the command line
* Enter your input as shown in the image below (please note that you have to add a space between 1 and the other number)
